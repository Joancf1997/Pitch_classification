# Pitch Classification ⚾️

This project is a **baseball pitch classification system** that leverages machine learning to identify the type of pitch thrown based on physical metrics such as velocity, spin rate, and trajectory data. It is inspired by real-world sports analytics applications and aims to deliver accurate pitch classification using a reproducible and well-documented pipeline.

## 🔍 Features

* 🎓 Supervised machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
* 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on pitch metrics
* ⚖️ Feature selection and engineering
* ✅ Model training and evaluation with performance metrics
* 💾 Reproducible Jupyter notebooks


## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

1. **Create a Python environment**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the notebooks**

   Open any Jupyter notebook in the `notebooks/` folder to explore the analysis or train models:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
